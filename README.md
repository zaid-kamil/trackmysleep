TrackMySleepQuality - Starter Code
==================================


Introduction
------------

TrackMySleepQuality is an app for recording sleep data for each night. 
You can record a start and stop time, assign a quality rating, and clear the database. 

In this codelab, working from this starter app,
you will implement the Room database that holds the sleep data. 
You will then use instrumented tests to verify that this backend works. 


Pre-requisites
--------------

You need to know:

* Building a basic user interface (UI) for an Android app, 
  using an activity, fragments, and views.
* Navigating between fragments and using Safe Args (a Gradle plugin) 
  to pass data between fragments.
* View models, view-model factories, and LiveData and its observers. 
  These Architecture Components topics are covered in an earlier codelab in this course.
* A basic understanding of SQL databases and the SQLite language.


Getting Started
---------------

1. Download and run the app.
